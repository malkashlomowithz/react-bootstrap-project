The range\'s highest peak rises 496 meters above sea level. A minor battle between the army of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and Sultan Saladin took place at the foot of Mount Gilboa in 1183. The 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut was fought at the foot of Mount Gilboa. The success of the Muslim Mamluks against the Mongols marked the end of the westward push of the Asian empire and ensured the survival of Muslim Egypt","high":536,"link":"https://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A2"},{"id":2,"name":"Mount Carmel","image":"/images/Isfije_075.jpg","geography":"The etymology and exact meaning of the name Carmel is disputed, but a large majority of concerned scholars see it as derived from the Semitic root krm, which sets it close to the noun \u05db\u05e8\u05dd (kerem), a word meaning vineyard.The addition of the suffix l is quite common in Hebrew. The common explanation is that the Hebrew word karmel means plantation, orchard, garden-growth or alike. However, in the context of the Hebrew Bible, the noun karmel appears to denote the scrubby woodland typical of the Carmel and other areas with Mediterranean climate in the Holy Land, an intermediate biome between the dry, semiarid steppe called midbar in Hebrew, and the ya\'ar, a forest like the ones in the mountains of Lebanon, with high-trunked trees, as for instance cedars.","high":546,"link":"https://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%9C"},{"id":3,"name":"Mount Hermon","image":"/images/hermon.jpg","geography":"The relatively narrow Hermon range, with the Lebanon-Syria boundary along its spine, extends for 70km, from 25km northeast of Mt. Hermon to 45km southwest of it. The Hermon range covers an area of about 700 km2 (270 sq mi) of which about 70 km2 (27 sq mi) are under Israeli control. Mount Hermon is a cluster of mountains with three distinct summits, each about the same height. Most of the portion of Mount Hermon within the Israeli-controlled area constitutes the Hermon nature reserve. The mountain forms one of the greatest geographic resources of the area. Because of its height it captures a great deal of precipitation in a very dry area of the world. The Jurassic limestone is broken by faults and solution channels to form a karst topography. Mount Hermon has seasonal winter and spring snow falls, which cover all three of its peaks for most of the year. Melt water from the snow-covered mountain\'s western and southern bases seeps into the rock channels and pores, feeding springs at the base of the mountain, which form streams and rivers. These merge to become the Jordan River. Additionally, the runoff facilitates fertile plant life below the snow line, where vineyards and pine, oak, and poplar trees are abundant.","high":536,"link":"https://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%A8_%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9F"},{"id":4,"name":"Mount Tabor","image":"/images/hartavor.jpg","geography":"Mount Tabor is shaped almost like half a sphere, suddenly rising from rather flat surroundings and reaching a height of 575 metres (1,886 feet), thus dominating by a good 450 metres the town in the plain below, Kfar Tavor. At the top of the mountain are two Christian monasteries, one Greek Orthodox on the northeast side and one Roman Catholic on the southeast side. The Catholic church at the top is easily visible from afar.The mountain is a monadnock: an isolated hill or small mountain rising abruptly from gently sloping or level surrounding land, and is not volcanic. citation needed In spite of its proximity to the Nazareth mountains, it constitutes a separate geological form .At the base it is almost fully surrounded by the Arab villages of Daburiyya, Shibli, and Umm al-Ghanam. Mount Tabor is located off Highway 65, and its summit is accessible by road via Shibli. A hiking tracks starts from the Bedouin village Shibli and is about five kilometers long. It is part of the Israel National Trail.","high":575,"link":"https://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%A8_%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A8"}]')},27:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var o=a(4),n=a(0),i=a(8),r=a.n(i),s=(a(23),a(29)),h=a(30),l=a(31),m=a(17),d=a(33),c=a(34),u=a(16);function f(e){var t=e.data,a=Object(n.useState)(!1),i=Object(m.a)(a,2),r=i[0],s=i[1];return Object(o.jsxs)(d.a,{className:" bg-whigt rounded shadow-sm rtl",children:[Object(o.jsx)(d.a.Img,{variant:"top",src:t.image}),Object(o.jsxs)(d.a.Body,{className:"d-flex flex-column",children:[Object(o.jsx)("div",{className:"d-flex mb-2 justify-center-between",children:Object(o.jsx)(d.a.Title,{className:"font-weight-bold mb-0",children:t.name})}),Object(o.jsx)(c.a,{variant:"light",onClick:function(){return s(!r)},"aria-expanded":r,className:"font-weight-bold",children:"Click me for more information"}),Object(o.jsx)(u.a,{in:r,children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:" mt-3",children:[t.geography,Object(o.jsxs)(d.a.Footer,{className:"font-weight-bold mb-0",children:[" height of: ",t.high," metres"]})]})})]})]})}var g=a(32);function b(){return Object(o.jsx)("div",{children:Object(o.jsx)(g.a,{expand:"lg",variant:"light",bg:"light",children:Object(o.jsx)("h1",{className:" justify-center",children:"Mountains of Israel:"})})})}var p=a(15);var w=function(){return Object(o.jsxs)(s.a,{children:[Object(o.jsx)(b,{}),Object(o.jsx)(h.a,{children:p.map((function(e){return Object(o.jsx)(l.a,{children:Object(o.jsx)(f,{data:e})})}))})]})};r.a.render(Object(o.jsx)(w,{}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[27,1,2]]]);
